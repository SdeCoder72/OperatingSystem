# üíª Operating System ‚Äì Fundamentals & Types

## ‚úÖ What Is OS?
A software layer that manages hardware and software resources, providing abstraction, security, and convenience to users.

## üîπ Why We Need OS?
- Avoid complexity of direct hardware interaction
- Protect memory between processes
- Coordinate resource allocation fairly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What If No OS?
- Every app must manage devices
- No isolation or protection
- High chance of system instability and resource abuse

## üß± OS Components
- File Management
- Memory Management
- Process Scheduling
- Device Management
- Security & User Interface

## üéØ Goals of OS
- Maximize CPU usage
- Reduce process starvation
- Prioritize high-value tasks

## üóÉÔ∏è Types of OS with Examples

| OS Type             | Description                                               | Example            |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Batch OS**         | Jobs executed in bulk, operator-managed                  | Punch card systems |
| **Single Process OS**| One process active at a time                             | MS DOS             |
| **Multiprogramming** | Multiple programs reside in memory, switch on I/O        | THE (Dijkstra)     |
| **Multitasking**     | Rapid task switching for responsiveness                  | Windows NT         |
| **Multi-processing** | Multiple CPUs handle separate tasks simultaneously       | Linux SMP systems  |
| **Distributed OS**   | Nodes share resources across networks                    | LOCUS              |
| **Real-Time OS**     | Tight time-bound execution for sensitive applications    | RTOS for robots    |

üß© Each type improves different performance goals (e.g., responsiveness, reliability, resource efficiency).
