# ðŸ§  Operating System â€“ Process States & Queues

## âœ… What Is a Process?
- A program in execution
- Has its own memory, registers, and execution context

## ðŸ”„ Process States

| State         | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| New           | Process is being created             |
| Ready         | Waiting to be assigned to CPU        |
| Running       | Currently executing on CPU           |
| Waiting       | Waiting for I/O or event             |
| Terminated    | Finished execution                   |

| Queue Type        | Role                              |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Job Queue         | All processes in the system       |
| Ready Queue       | Processes ready to run            |
| Device Queue      | Waiting for I/O devices           |
