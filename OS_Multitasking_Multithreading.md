# üß† OS ‚Äì Multitasking vs Multithreading

## ‚úÖ Multitasking
- OS runs multiple processes seemingly at once
- Each process has its own memory space
- Example: Listening to music while browsing

## ‚úÖ Multithreading
- A single process has multiple threads sharing memory
- Threads run concurrently for efficiency
- Example: Spell check + typing in Word
